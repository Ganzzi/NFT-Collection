# Desciption
Welcome to NFT Collection, a web application enable user to create their own NFTs, also list NFTs into the marketplace to sell, update price, remove from the marketplace. This project was built as part of a coding challenge and serves as a showcase for my coding abilities. My achievement: https://dacade.org/achievements/f056bb1e-9f92-49bc-82d1-8f301152c792

# Feature
- Create new NFT collections and tokens
- Customize the metadata of the tokens (name, description, image, etc.)
- View your own tokens and collections, as well as those of other users
- Buy and sell tokens on the marketplace, with CELO as the currency
- Update and remove their own tokens from the marketplace
- Connect to a wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to interact with the Ethereum network

# Tech Stack
This web aplication uses the following tech stack:
- [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) - A programming language for Ethereum smart contracts.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [use-Contractkit](contractkit
) - A frontend library for interacting with the Celo blockchain.
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) - A tool for writing and deploying smart contracts.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - A CSS framework that provides responsive, mobile-first layouts.

# Usage
1. Install a wallet:
   - [CeloExtensionWallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/celoextensionwallet/kkilomkmpmkbdnfelcpgckmpcaemjcdh?hl=en).
   - [MetamaskExtensionWallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en).
2. Create a wallet.
3. Go to [https://celo.org/developers/faucet](https://celo.org/developers/faucet) and get tokens for the alfajores testnet.
4. Switch to the alfajores testnet in the CeloExtensionWallet.

# Test
